# pfi-vacancy-report
This code is for a spreadsheet app that helps the real estate clients marketing department to manage the listing of vacancies across multiple properties by downloading reports from Yardi, then performing functions that check for changed status of a unit (bonus added, bonus changed, rent changed, rented, vacant) and then sorting the information into the Listing Manager tab into an easy interface that shows the Listing Manager which units need to be advertised and all the information needed to include in the advertisement. This spreadsheet app imports 3 reports from Yardi (Available Units, Pending Make Ready, and Units). It then converts the reports into google sheets, imports these sheets into the main spreadsheet app file and then deletes duplicates from previous import. Next, it performs functions to preserve data that would be lost upon a new import, sets status of units, and formats rows for easy identification of units needing advertisements or adjustments to advertising. Later, we will also be mapping the units needing advertising to CSV columns formatted for uploading and updating the property listing web app items on the Adobe Business Catalyst website.  This will facilitate semi automatic posting and updating of listings on the clients website my simply downloading the Yardi reports into Google Drive and then running the functions via a  button on the interface of the spreadsheet.  Also, we are planning on developing another app that will import the CVS into the web app automatically directly from Google Drive.
